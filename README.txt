# README

My GitHub page is: https://github.com/josephone

In my com2025_coursework repository, it appears that there is only 4 commits, however this was not the case as I overwrote previous commits. The actual amount can be seen in my account page on GitHub in my commit history.

This is my Film Reviews website where you are able to do a variety of things, whether logged in or not. If you are not logged in, you are able to sign up for an account or sign in to a currently existing account. You are also able to view films that have been reviewed and submit a contact form which gets sent via a mailer.

If you are logged in you are able to create your own film reviews which will be inputted into the database. You are also able to edit previous entries and delete entries. The navigation bar changes once you are logged in, and instead of being presented with the sign up and sign in options, you are able to log out which will destroy the current user session.

I have included best practices in terms of styling decisions and jQuery inclusion across the site and I have implemented boilerplate constructs on all pages. Additionally, the Devise gem is being used for form validation across the site which is also rigorously tested in my test folders.

I hope you like my website!

Joseph
