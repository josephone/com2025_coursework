# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# x=0
# 1000.times do |x|
#   x+=1
#   film_title = "joe is cool"
#   description = "joe is a very cool man in his own film....but he dies"
#   length = "too long"
#   Film.create!(
#       Film_title: film_title,
#       description: description,
#       Length: length)
#     puts "created film joe #{x}"
# end
